olca-ipc.py
===========

openLCA provides an `implementation <https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-modules/tree/master/olca-ipc>`_
of an `JSON-RPC <http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`_ based protocol for
inter-process communication (IPC). With this, it is possible to call functions
in openLCA and processing their results outside of openLCA. The ``olca-ipc.py``
package provides a convenience API for using this IPC protocol from standard
Python (Cpython v3.4+) so that it is possible to use openLCA as a data storage
and calculation engine and combine it with the libraries from the Python
ecosystem.

The openLCA IPC protocol is based on the openLCA data exchange format which is
specified in the `olca-schema <https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-schema>`_
repository. The ``olca-ipc.py`` package provides a class based implementation of
the openLCA data exchange format and an API for communicating with an openLCA
IPC server via instances of these classes.

Usage
-----
We will distribute the package later on PyPi; to install the current development
version just do: 

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e .

Running the tests:

.. code:: bash

    python -m unittest discover tests -v

Connecting with openLCA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to communicate with openLCA, you first need to start the openLCA
IPC server. You can do this via the user interface in openLCA under
``Window > Developer Tools > IPC Server``. The IPC server runs on a specific
port, e.g. ``8080``, to which you connect from an IPC client:

.. code-block:: python

    import olca
    client = olca.Client(8080)

An instance of the ``olca.Client`` class is then a convenient entry point for
calling functions of openLCA and processing their results.

Browsing the database content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The method ``get_descriptors`` returns a list of data set references with some
meta-data for a given data set type (like ``olca.Flow``, ``Ã²lca.Process``,
etc.):

.. code-block:: python

    methods = client.get_descriptors(olca.ImpactMethod)
    for method in methods:
        print('%s\t%s' % (method.id, method.name))


Insert, update, delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    actor = olca.Actor()
    actor.id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    actor.name = 'A test actor'
    resp = client.insert(actor)
    print(resp)  #  should print ' ok'
